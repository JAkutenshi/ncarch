# NCArch project

## Introduction

Main purpose: this program should offer to user ability to zip/unzip archives most common in linux system archives types via ncurses UI.

The reasons for developing:
- For using tar, for example, user should learn strange launch keys x-c-r. It's hard to remember;
- For using different archivers and zip-formats user should learn or repeat man reading for every single program;
- User want common interface for different archivers;
- Users such CLI programs as ranger, may need CLI archiver for fast mouseless workflow with documents.

## Roadmap

[] Create list of supported archivers;
[] Create UseCase diagram for selected archivers abilities and user needs;
[] Create UI moshup;
[] Create ncurses stub UI prototype;
[] Create bind interfaces for archive programs interaction;
[] Create unit tests for interaction logic module;
[] Create integration tests for interaction module;
[] Create controllers and bind logic with UI;
[] Release 1.0v.
